# tklbox
tackle box app
tklbox
tackle box directory, help you figure out which lures to bring with you so you can minimize the amount of stuff you carry

I love fishing, but I alwasy find myself wondering what lures I have and what I should bring with me on every trip. Too much time spent figuring out your lures and switching lures is time that you don't have a line in the water. No line in the water means less fish. So I wanted to create a tackle box that will help me keep organized and let you figure out what lure you should bring based on the conditions.

App will include

Index of lure types
Lure type will have an index of all lures you have of that type
Details on each lure including color, weight, best conditions, etc
Ability to add new lures
Ability to remove lost lures
Ability to edit lures if you make tweaks to them
App will use Node.JS, Mogoose, Express, and EJS. Will adhere to MVC file structure. 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD. Deployed via Heroku. Sign/up/login with encrypted passwords and authorization.
